[AnsiColors](https://github.com/thomas-olijnsma/AnsiColors) is a C++17(+) header-only API that provides an easy to use, high level API. The goal of this project is to be a low overhead, typesafe, and logical abstraction layer; build on top of the [ANSI 256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) escape codes. <br>
<br>
This API offers sorted and named color palettes for **all 256 color codes**. Both the **foreground** and **background** colors are separated from each other by the `fg` and the `bg` namespace. It also offers a `TextStyle` struct containing the ANSI codes for all common **text style** attributes and also a `Reset` struct with multiple **reset** options for both **colors** and **text styles**. Both the *fg* and *bg* namespace contain the color categories: `PrimaryColors`, `SecondaryColors`, `TertiaryColors`, and `GrayScaleColors`; which in turn contain the actual pallettes (colors). Each color listed in the color  categories **(exept for the `Shades` palette)** consists out of two differently designed color palettes using the same color codes associated to that specific color. The first palette offers unique names for all colors. The second palette is a from dark- to lighter color codes and it also offers access to the color codes by a `const Color& operator[](index)` operator overload.
