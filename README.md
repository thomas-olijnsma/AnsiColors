[AnsiColors](https://github.com/thomas-olijnsma/AnsiColors) is a C++ 17(+) header-only API that provides an easy to use, high level API. The goal of the project is to be a low overhead, typesafe, and logical abstraction layer; build on top of the [ANSI-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) escape sequences. <br>
This API does not only offer the standard 16 ANSI-256 terminal colors, but it also includes the *extended* ANSI-256 color codes; a **TextStyles** struct that holds the escape sequences for common text style attributes; and a **Reset** struct that contains all the nessesary reset escape
